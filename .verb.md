## Usage

Wrap a function like this:

```js
var cache = require('{%= name %}');
var someRegex = cache(require('some-regex-lib'));
```

**Caching a regex**

If you want to cache a regex after calling `new RegExp()`, or you're requiring a module that returns a regex, wrap it with a function first: 

```js
var cache = require('{%= name %}');

function yourRegex(str, opts) {
  // do stuff to str and opts
  return new RegExp(str, opts.flags);
}

var regex = cache(yourRegex);
```

### Recommendations

* **Use this when no options are passed** to the function that creates the regex. Regardless of how big or small the regex is, when zero options are passed, caching will be faster than not.
* **Do not use this when** you are passing options to create a simple regex. No matter how many options are passed, one or fifty, a simple regex will not benefit from caching.
* However, if the logic for creating the regex is extensive (much more than the logic used in [support.js](./support.js), like with globbing, brace expansion, etc), then it might make sense to use this if options are passed.

### Example benchmarks

[Performance results](#benchmarks) for a random regex lib, [mentions-regex], with and without regex-cache, and no options passed:

```bash
#1: no-args passed, and defaults are used
  with-cache.js x 9,141,988 ops/sec ±0.61% (98 runs sampled)
  without-cache.js x 2,818,715 ops/sec ±0.48% (99 runs sampled)

#2: a string is passed
  with-cache.js x 7,479,890 ops/sec ±0.66% (95 runs sampled)
  without-cache.js x 2,123,907 ops/sec ±0.33% (98 runs sampled)
```

## What it does

If you're using `new RegExp('foo')` instead of a regex literal, it's probably because you need to dyamically generate a regex based on user options or some other potentially changing factors. 

When your function creates a string based on user inputs and passes it to the `RegExp` constructor, regex-cache caches the results. The next time the function is called if the key of a cached regex matches the user input (or no input was given), the cached regex is returned, avoiding unnecessary runtime compilation.

Using the RegExp constructor offers a lot of flexibility, but the runtime compilation comes at a price - it's slow. Not specifically because of the call to the RegExp constructor, but **because you have to build up the string before `new RegExp()` is even called**.
