## Usage

If the lib returns a function, you can wrap it like this:

```js
var cache = require('{%= name %}');
var regex = cache(require('some-regex-lib'));
```

Or, if the lib (or your own function) returns a regex, you can wrap it with a function first to achieve the same results.

### Recommendations

**DO** use this when:

* you're **not** passing options (regardless of how big or small the regex is, caching makes it faster)
* you are passing options and the logic for creating the regex is extensive (like with globbing, brace expansion, etc)

**DO NOT** use this when:

* you are passing options to create a simple regex


### Example benchmarks

[Performance results](#benchmarks) for a random regex lib, [mentions-regex], with and without regex-cache, and no options passed:

```bash
with regex-cache x 11,256,663 ops/sec ±0.59% (97 runs sampled)
without regex-cache x 1,812,916 ops/sec ±1.66% (24 runs sampled)
```

## What it does

If you're using `new RegExp('foo')` instead of a regex literal, it's probably because you need to dyamically generate a regex based on user options or some other potentially changing factors. 

regex-cache is a simple way to cache the results of a previous call to the RegExp constructor to avoid unnecessary runtime compilation when both the string and options being passed have not changed.

Using the RegExp constructor offers a lot of flexibility, but the runtime compilation comes at a price - it's slow. Not specifically because of the call to the RegExp constructor, but because you have to build up the string to create the regex based on various inputs.
